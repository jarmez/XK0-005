# Lab files for All-in-one CompTIA Linux+ Certification Exam Guide XK0-005 (Second Edition)
## What is this?

These are the lab files that are contained within the Centos7 Lab VM provided by McGraw Hill as a resource for the book.
I have extracted the folder from the VM so that it can be used with self-build VM's etc.
For example, I was unable to run the VirtualBox built OVM (or the converted qcow disk images I made) in my QEMU/KVM environment.
Feel free to use these to construct your own lab to fit your own requirements. 

As far as I know these resources themselves are not subject to a copyright (liek the book), but I am happy to be corrected on that,
